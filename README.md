## NOTE

This is a upgrade of the project [Arms Reach](https://github.com/psyny/FoundryVTT/tree/master/ArmsReach) ty to [psyny](https://github.com/psyny), in preparation of foundry vtt 0.8.0

### NOTE FROM PSYNY ABOUT 0.7.X and forks!
>>>>>>> e5fa7bed634fd7062ac91e1048176d16c1f24ea2

This module uses the [libWrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper) library for wrapping core methods. It is a hard dependency and it is recommended for the best experience and compatibility with other modules.

### Disclaimer

This features of this module was first part of my (Cozy Player)[https://github.com/psyny/FoundryVTT/tree/master/CozyPlayer] module. I've decided to make this a separate module to make it work with other systems beyond Dungeons And Dragons.

If FVTT adds windows and other interactibles I plan to update this module to support it.

## Usage

The iteraction distance is measure by the distance between a token and the door. So, to iteract with a door, the player need to have a token selected (or own a token).

## Features

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Enable the GM to select the maximum distancce that players can interact with a door (needs a token selected) (DM bypass this limitation)

* Holding 'e' centers the camera on current selected token
* Double tapping movement on the direction of a door will interact with it

## Issues

None up until now.
